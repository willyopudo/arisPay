# arisPay
### About
ArisPay is a software-as-a-service project that aims to integrate local banks in real time via open bank APIs to help Kenyan MSMEs initiate, monitor, and reconcile payments and disbursements centrally.

### Background Information
<p>Local small and medium businesses lack proper real-time bank integration services to help them reconcile and process transactions seamlessly</p>
<p>It is expensive for them to build their own integration and reconciliation systems because vendors/developers charge higher fees for standalone solutions and deployments.</p>
<br>
<p>ArisPay project seeks to solve this problem by providing a Software as a Service platform where such businesses can be onboarded and enabled to manage their transactions and financial metrics in a consolidated central space.</p>
<br>
<p>Integration with most local banks has been made possible with the emergence of Open Banking APIs. These APIs enable external developers to query and consume bank data at will, such as transaction query, Instant Payment Notifications, bill number and customer detail validation, balance inquiry, fund transfer, bulk payments, account statements among other services.</p>
