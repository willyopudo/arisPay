# arisPay
### About
ArisPay is a Software as a Service project with the objective of providing real time integration to local banks via open bank APIs to help kenyan MSMEs initiate, monitor and reconcile payments and disbursements centrally.

### Background Information
<p>Local small and medium businesses lack proper real time bank integration services to help them reconcile and process transactions seamlessly</p>
<p>It is expensive for them to build their own integration and reconciliation systems because vendors/developers charge higher fee for stand alone solutions and deployments.</p>
<br>
<p>ArisPay project seek to solve this problem by providing a Software as a Service platform where such business can be onboarded and be enabled to manage their transactions and financial metrics in a consolidated central space.</p>
<br>
<p>Integration to most local banks has been made possible with the emergence of Open Banking APIs. These APIs enable external developers to query and consume bank data at will such as transaction query, Instant Payment Notifications, bill number and customer detail validation, balance inquiry, fund transfer, bulk payments, account statements among other services.</p>
